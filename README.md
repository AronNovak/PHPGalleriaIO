# Summary
Dead-simple, minimalistic PHP-based photo gallery for your files if you'd
like to host them yourself, but still you would expect something decent.

# Demo
http://aron.novaak.net/PHPGalleriaIO-Demo/

# Requirements
PHP 5.4.x or newer

# Usage
Copy all the files in this repository to a directory that you'd like to turn
into a web gallery. Or put images to this repository (and copy it to a server).

It scans all JPEG and PNG files in all subdirectories and puts into one flat
gallery, sorted by the filename.
The filename minus the extension is the caption that's visible for the photos.

# Advanced usage
See config.php for various configuration options.

# Credits
Thanks for the amazing http://galleria.io/ that could make this little repo happen.
